# LLM Wiki — Ting-Chun Liu

This folder is a knowledge base about the artist Ting-Chun Liu (劉庭均), built on the
"LLM Wiki" pattern (https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f):
instead of searching raw material on every question, a language model writes and keeps up
a set of interlinked Markdown pages. Later, the chat box on the website answers visitors'
questions from these pages.

This file is the **schema**: read it before touching anything in `wiki/`.

## Layers

| Layer | Where | Who changes it |
|---|---|---|
| Raw sources | `../data/site.json`, `../posts/*.md`, `raw/` (anything the artist drops in) | the artist; the LLM only reads |
| Wiki | `pages/`, `index.md`, `log.md` | the LLM |
| Schema | this file | the artist and the LLM together |

## Ground rules

1. **Only public, sourced facts.** Every statement must be traceable to a raw source or a
   public page. If something is not in the sources, write "unknown" — never guess dates,
   venues, awards, collaborators or quotes.
2. **Cite.** Each page ends with `## Sources`; each source is a repo path or a public URL.
3. **Nothing private.** No home address, phone number, private email threads, health,
   family or finances, even if a raw source contains them. Contact = the public email
   tingchun.liu.tw@gmail.com only. Material in `raw/private/` is never used.
4. **The artist's own wording wins.** When the site text and a later source disagree, keep
   both, flag it under `## Open questions`, and add a line to `log.md`.
5. **English** is the wiki language; keep original titles (German, Chinese) next to the
   English ones. The chat answers in the visitor's language.
6. **Pronouns:** the artist's own bio uses "he". Prefer the name ("Liu") in running text.

## Page format

```markdown
---
title: <page title>
type: overview | work | topic | text | person | institution | list | faq
tags: [short, lowercase, tags]
sources:
  - <repo path or URL>
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
---
# <title>

<one-paragraph summary a visitor could read on its own>

... body ...

## Related
- [Other page](relative/path.md)

## Sources
- <same list, human-readable>
```

- Links are plain relative Markdown links (they work on GitHub, in Obsidian and in the
  chat's citations). One page per work, topic, person and institution. A `text` page summarises one of Liu's own written texts (thesis, essay, article) in enough detail to answer questions about its arguments, with the original link.
- File names: lowercase, hyphenated, ASCII (work pages use the website slug).

## The chat's voice

The homepage chat (worker/src/index.js) answers from these pages. Facts about Liu come only
from the wiki; around them it may interpret, connect works and ideas, bring in general
knowledge about art and technology, and answer playful questions playfully, as long as it
marks a reading as a reading. So: write pages with the facts sharp and sourced, and give
"Key ideas" sections enough substance for the chat to think with.

The chat never uses dashes (— or –, or the Chinese ——) as punctuation: the artist does not
want that AI writing habit in its answers. The rule is in `RULES` in worker/src/index.js, and
assets/chat.js replaces any that slip through. (Dashes inside wiki pages are fine.)

## Workflows

**Ingest** (new material in `raw/` or a change in `site.json`):
1. Read the new source.
2. Update or create every affected page (work, topics, people, institutions, timeline).
3. Update `index.md` (one line per page) and append to `log.md`:
   `## [YYYY-MM-DD] ingest | <source>` plus a bullet list of pages touched.

**Query** (a visitor's question, or the artist's):
1. Read `index.md` first, then the relevant pages.
2. Answer only from the wiki, link the pages used, say so when the wiki has no answer.
3. A good new answer can be filed back as a page (or into `faq.md`).

**Lint** (from time to time, and before each release of the chat):
1. `python3 scripts/wiki-lint.py` — broken links, pages missing from the
   index, missing front matter or sources.
2. Read for contradictions, stale claims ("upcoming" events now past), works on the
   website without a page, and gaps worth asking the artist about (`## Open questions`).
